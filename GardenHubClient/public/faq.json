    "question": "How can I learn more about gardening in Colorado?",
    "answer": "There are several ways! We work with volunteer gardeners to offer free workshops throughout the season on topics such as installing drip irrigation, amending soil, and growing flowers. Tips and tricks are also included in the monthly community garden newsletter. Garden leaders and fellow gardeners are also an invaluable resource for learning the ins and outs of gardening in our climate. Each garden has a directory of fellow gardeners with their contact information, unless folks opt out, so you can contact the gardeners around your plot. Gardeners receive this directory once the gardens are full for the season. Growing Gardens also offers paid Classes each spring! ."

    "question": "Who is responsible for rototilling?",

  {
    "question": "What are the rules regarding manure in the gardens?",

    "question": "Is theft and vandalism a problem at the gardens?",
    "answer": "Theft and vandalism can occur at the community gardens from time to time. Occasionally things are lost to hungry visitors passing by or to four footed friends. The Hawthorn Community Garden has also experienced an up-tick in vandalism over the past couple of years. We appreciate gardeners watching for looters and vandals and informing us when they see produce being stolen or things being damaged. We encourage gardeners to report theft to their City Police Departments via the non-emergency numbers. Please also let Growing Gardens and your garden leaders know if theft has occurred. "

    "question": "Will I have access to shared tools?",
    "answer": "Shared tools are located in the sheds at each garden, with the exception of a few, where the tools are kept in a storage box. Community tools have brightly painted handles to identify them. The combinations for the locks will be given at orientation or can be obtained by calling the office at (303) 443-9952."

  {
    "question": "How does irrigation work at the gardens?",
    "answer": "Our partner organizations decide when the water will be turned on at each garden. For example, the City of Boulder decides when to turn on the water at the Hawthorn, Foothills, Fortune, and Hickory Community Gardens. Weather permitting, the water will be turned on as soon as possible in the spring. This will likely happen in March, but is weather dependent.  The water will be turned off as necessary when the temperature changes in the fall. Again, these dates are weather dependent and vary at each garden each season. Drip irrigation is required at several of the gardens, and strongly encouraged at non-required locations. Refer to the specific garden location’s rules if you aren’t sure about your garden. This is also covered during the Spring garden orientation."

  {
    "question": "Who should I talk to with a question about the gardens?",
    "answer": "Each garden has an appointed leader who can answer questions. Contact info is shared after plot registration."
